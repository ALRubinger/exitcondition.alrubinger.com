# **Markdown Guide and Styles Example**
This reference shows the supported Markdown > HTML styles and how they'll render on the page. It's
used both for development of this theme and as a reference for authors writing new documentation.

It is adapted from [`@allysonsilva`'s excellent example](https://gist.github.com/allysonsilva/85fff14a22bbdf55485be947566cc09e).

# Headers (This is an **H1**)
Looking good. And this is what body text will look like under it. Let's do the rest.

## This is an **H2** Header

### This is an **H3** Header

#### This is an **H4** Header

##### This is an **H5** Header

###### This is an **H6** Header. Can you still read me?

# Emphasis

See Markdown Documentation [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#emphasis)
and [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#strikethrough).

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* `*` or _underscores_ `_` surrounding the text.

Strong **emphasis**, aka **bold**, with two **asterisks** `**` or __underscores__ `__` surrounding the text.

~~Strikethrough~~ uses two tildes `~~`.

You may *combine ~~some~~ __emphasis__* using these together.

# Lists

## Unordered Lists

See [Markdown Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#unordered-lists).

* First item 
  * 2nd-level sub-item 
    * 3rd-level sub-item 
      * 4th level sub-item 
   * 2nd, 2nd-level sub-item 

## Ordered Lists

See [Markdown Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#ordered-lists).

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
    1. Indented item
    2. Indented item
4. Fourth item

------

# Task lists

See [Markdown Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#task-lists)

- [x] Completed item
- [ ] Incomplete item you probably should finish

------

# Ignoring Markdown formatting

See [Markdown Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#escaping-characters).

You may ignore (espace) Markdown formatting by using `\` before the Markdown character.

For instance: "Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*".

------

# Links

See [Markdown Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#links).

Here's an [inline-style link](https://www.google.com) 
and [another inline-style link with a title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage").
URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links, like http://www.google.com.

------

# Images

See [Markdown Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#images-1). Please
remember to use `alt` text and titles.

![alt text](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/8m3angk4/production/a0b3ab0a0abdd1755bb7864b34fcbfc5967206cf-1200x675.gif?auto=format "Block Logo")

# Fenced Code Blocks

See Markdown Documentation [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#code) 
and [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks).

Inline `code` has back-ticks `` ` `` surrounding it. Code blocks have 3 back-ticks `` ``` `` 
in the lines above and below the code block. The back-ticks above the code block may optionally denote
a language like `` ```javascript `` or `` ```css ``.

## JavaScript
```javascript
function $initHighlight(block, cls) {
  try {
    if (cls.search(/\bno\-highlight\b/) != -1)
      return process(block, true, 0x0F) +
             ` class="${cls}"`;
  } catch (e) {
    /* handle exception */
  }
  for (var i = 0 / 2; i < classes.length; i++) {
    if (checkCondition(classes[i]) === undefined)
      console.log('undefined');
  }
}
```

## CSS
```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Chunkfive; src: url('Chunkfive.otf');
}

body, .usertext {
  color: #F0F0F0; background: #600;
  font-family: Chunkfive, sans;
}

@import url(print.css);
@media print {
  a[href^=http]::after {
    content: attr(href)
  }
}
```

### Java
```java
import static System.out;

public static void main(String[] args) {
  out.println("Testing Java");
}
```

------

# Tables

See [Markdown Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#tables).

There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
The outer pipes `|` are optional, and you don't need to make the
raw Markdown line up prettily. You can also use inline Markdown.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `git status` | List all *new or modified* files |
| `git diff` | Show file differences that **haven't been** staged |

Colons can be used to align columns left `:---`, center `:---:`, or right ` ---:`.

| Left-aligned | Center-aligned | Right-aligned |
| :---         |     :---:      |          ---: |
| `git status`   | `git status`     | `git status`    |
| `git diff`     | `git diff`       | `git diff`      |

------

# Blockquotes

See [Markdown Documentation](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#blockquotes-1).

> Blockquotes are very handy in email to emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote even though the source is on a new line.

Quote break.

> This is a very long line that will still be quoted properly when it wraps. Oh boy let's keep writing to make sure this is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. You can *put* **Markdown** into a blockquote.

> Blockquotes can also be nested...
>> ...by using additional greater-than `>` signs right next to each other...
> > > ...or with spaces between arrows.

------

# Horizontal Rules

Create a horizonal rule with 3 or more:

* Hyphens `---`
* Asterisks `***`
* or Underscores `___` 

...on its own line.
