This guide will walk you through writing a new blog post. 

## Writing a Blog Post

<Aside>
  This is a work in progress as we build out the blog system. - ALR
</Aside>

<Steps>
<ol>
  <li>
    ### Add Yourself as an Author

    <Aside type="note">
      This only needs to be done once, before your first post.
    </Aside>

    Open `src/content/blog/authors.json` in a file editor.

    <FileTree>
    - src
      - content 
        - blog
          - authors.json
    </FileTree>

    Add an entry for yourself, following the format:
    
    ```javascript
      {
        "alrubinger" : {
          "name": "Andrew Lee Rubinger",
          "title": "Lead, Open Source Program Office, Block",
          "social-github": "ALRubinger",
          "social-linkedin": "alrubinger",
          "social-x": "ALRubinger"
        }
        ...more
      }
    ```

    This is the schema:

    | Property  | Description and Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
    |-----------|-----------------------|
    | `id` | Unique ID for you; this is what you'll put in the metadata of your blog entries when you write an post. |
    | `author` | The the key of the author in `./src/content/blog/authors.yaml` - defines who wrote the post |
    | `title` | Your job title. What would you say...you *do* here? |
    | `social-github` | Your GitHub username |
    | `social-LinkedIn` | Your LinkedIn username |
    | `social-x` | Your X, formerly Twitter, username |

  </li>
  <li> 
    ### Make a File for your Blog Post

    Create a new `.mdx` file in `/src/content/blog/posts`:
    <FileTree>
    - src
      - content 
        - blog
          - posts
            - my-post.mdx
    </FileTree>

    In this example, the URL of the blog post will be `http(s)://<$domain>/<$baseURL>/blog/my-post`. 
    URL Routing is determined by the filename without the `.mdx` extension. So choose your filename 
    with its target URL in mind.
  </li>
  <li>

    ### Add Metadata

    At the top of the file you've just created, add 
    "[frontmatter](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/)", a series of 
    metadata wrapped in `---` above and below. For instance:

    ```bash theme="terminal" title="/src/blog/my-post.mdx"

    ---
    title: Title of my blog post
    author: alrubinger
    pubDate: 2025-03-22
    ---

    ```

    The following properties apply:

    | Property  | Description and Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
    |-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `title`   | The title of the blog post                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
    | `author`  | The the key of the author in `./src/content/blog/authors.yaml` - defines who wrote the post                                                                                                                                                                                     |
    | `pubDate` | Date in [`ISO 8601`](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) or short-form `YYYY-MM-DD` <br />format. The short form is acceptable because the formatting <br />the docs system uses will drop precision and only show the day<br /> and date of the post, leaving off the time.  |

    <Aside>
      This section on frontmatter properties will evolve as we build out the schema for blog posts. - ALR

    ### Write your Post

    Blog Posts are written in Markdown, and because it's a full MDX format, this supports all
    dynamic content available to Astro or any of the rest of the docs system as shown in the examples.
    For instance, we can drop complex component sets in here if we want to. Like this:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem label="Java">
      
        ```java title="Sup.java"
        public static void main(String[] args){
            System.out.println("Sup?");
        }
        ```

      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="JavaScript">
      
        ```javascript title="sup.js"
        console.log("You tell me what's up?");
        ```
      
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem label="COBOL">
      
        ```bash theme="terminal" title="Just Kidding"
        $> echo 'I have no idea how to write in COBOL'
        ```
      
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
  </li>
</ol>

</Steps>
