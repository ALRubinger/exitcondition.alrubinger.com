I needed another post here to see how the content collections handles 
automatically listing all posts in the `src/blog` folder and sorting them
in the index page by "most recent". Seems to be going OK.
Nothing else interesting to see here. 

Look at the other, first blog post entry for something useful - the guide to authoring
blog posts.
