import { Aside, FileTree, Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Blog Posts are written in Markdown, and because it's a full MDX format, this supports all
dynamic content available to Astro or any of the rest of the docs system as shown in the examples.
For instance, we can drop complex component sets in here if we want to.

## Multilanguage Code Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Java">
  
    ```java title="Sup.java"
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Sup?");
    }
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
  
    ```javascript title="sup.js"
    console.log("You tell me what's up?");
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="COBOL">
  
    ```bash theme="terminal" title="Just Kidding"
    $> echo 'I have no idea how to write in COBOL'
    ```
  
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Writing a Blog Post

<Aside>
  This is a work in progress as we build out the blog system. - ALR
</Aside>

<Steps>
<ol>
  <li> 
    Create a new `.mdx` file in `/src/blog`:
    <FileTree>
    - src
      - blog
        - my-post.mdx
    </FileTree>

    In this example, the URL of the blog post will be `http(s)://<$domain>/<$baseURL>/blog/my-post`. 
    URL Routing is determined by the filename without the `.mdx` extension. So choose your filename 
    with its target URL in mind.
  </li>
  <li>

    At the top of the file you've just created, add 
    "[frontmatter](https://docs.astro.build/en/basics/astro-components/)", a series of 
    metadata wrapped in `---` above and below. For instance:

    ```bash theme="terminal" title="/src/blog/my-post.mdx"

    ---
    title: Title of my blog post
    pubDate: 2025-03-22
    ---

    ```

    The following properties apply:

    | Property  | Description and Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
    |-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | `title`   | The title of the blog post                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
    | `pubDate` | Date in [`ISO 8601`](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) or short-form `YYYY-MM-DD` <br />format. The short form is acceptable because the formatting <br />the docs system uses will drop precision and only show the day<br /> and date of the post, leaving off the time.  |

    <Aside>
      This section on frontmatter properties will evolve as we build out the schema for blog posts. - ALR
